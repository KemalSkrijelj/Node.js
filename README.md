# Node.js and Express.js Examples

This repository contains simple examples of using Node.js and Express.js to build HTTP servers and RESTful APIs. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the code locally.

## Prerequisites

- **Install Node.js**  
   Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. Download and install the latest stable version from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).  
   After installation, verify by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

- **Clone the Repository**  
Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kcne/cnit-bootcamp.git
  cd cnit-bootcamp
  cd 1
  ```


## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory and week folder and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Code**  
   To start the examples, use the following command:
   ```bash
   node <filename>
   ```
   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the example file you want to run (e.g., `server.js` or `rest-api.js`).

3. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser or API testing tool (e.g., Postman) and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```


## Examples Included

- **Basic HTTP Server**: Simple Node.js server using the `http` module.
- **Express.js Basics**: Example routes with dynamic parameters and responses.
- **RESTful API**: CRUD operations for managing user data.


## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have Node.js installed and are running the commands in the correct directory.
- If the port `3000` is already in use, change it in the code to an available port.
