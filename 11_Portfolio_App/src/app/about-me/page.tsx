        Hi, I am a Software Engineering student at the State University of Novi
        Pazar with a strong passion for web and backend development. I have
        experience working with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma, and I am
        always looking to expand my skills. üíª I enjoy coding in JavaScript,
        Python, C, and SQL, and I am currently deepening my knowledge of
        Tailwind CSS and backend technologies. I also have Google certifications
        in fundamental marketing, web development, and Taiwan CSS, showcasing my
        commitment to continuous learning. üîç My interests include API
        development, database management, and optimizing performance for web
        applications. Whether it is frontend, backend, or full-stack
        development, I love tackling new challenges and improving user
        experiences.
